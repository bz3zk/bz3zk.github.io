Why worry about doing it again?

Well, life is short, and we never know what will happen tomorrow. A few years ago, I built the same website/blog, but ended up deleting it, mostly because I wasn't sure about its purpose. However, as CJ said, "Ah, sh*t, here we go again."

In my 30 years of life, I have become an expert at starting projects but not finishing them. I always start something new and exciting, but I give up on it after a week.

But, as life has caught up with me, I've realized that I only have one opportunity to do things before I'm too old to have the same energy, excitement, or—sadly—life.

So, here we are. I'm going to try writing once a week. I don't know what I'll write about, but there will be something here. Ultimately, I'm doing this for myself (and maybe a future employer, wink wink).
