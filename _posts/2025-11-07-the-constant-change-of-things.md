Why do we like to put ourselves in a "role"?

At the beginning of our careers, or sometimes even earlier, we think of ourselves as a "prospect" of becoming something with a label: a police officer, an astronaut, a programmer, a dancer, etc.

We don't think about enjoying something we like that inspires us to create things that make us feel fulfilled and happy. We only focus on getting money and recognition for that label we picked.

For many years, I was "the guy who knows more about computers than the finance guys and more about finance than the computer guys." It used to feel bad because I didn't have a role or a label associated with me. I was just doing things neither of them wanted to do.

But that has changed with time. I don't care about labels or roles anymore. I might have one in my work ID, but that's it. I do things because I like doing them, because I find them interesting, or simply out of curiosity and I have never felt more alive.

That's the purpose of life, at least from this perspective: do things, have fun, and meet awesome people. When your time comes, you'll have a lot of stories to take with you.
