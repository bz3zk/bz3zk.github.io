Hi! My name is David Correa, a 30 years old Mexican dude who like's videogames (how original) and write dumb code for fun (also, how original).

Even tho my native language is Spanish, this page/blog is completly in English, mostly because I wanted to improve my writing, how I comunicate my ideas/thoughts and my grammar.

If you're visiting this page is either because I sent you a copy of my CV or somehow you find it, anyhow, feel free to explore (right now there is not that much, still WIP) and reach out if you need anything.
